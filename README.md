The source code files are written in Oberon-07.
They were successfully compled using the following Oberon compilers:

1. https://github.com/vishaps/voc
2. https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler
3. http://miasap.se/obnc/ OR https://github.com/GunterMueller/OBNC
4. https://github.com/Vostok-space/vostok

For example, in Linux/Unix use the commands: voc -m DeepNeuralQuantumANU.obn && 
./DeepNeuralQuantumANU > a.out to compile and run the program, which will
write all data to the file called a.out.
